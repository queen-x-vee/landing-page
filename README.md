## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.


## General description of this project

The code in this repository is meant to satisfy the project # 3 rubric of the Front Ent Web Developer nanodegree. Most of the code was written in the JavaScript file, with a few CSS codes. JavaScript was used to dynamically create the Navigation bar.

## List of software required
To get started, open `js/app.js` 

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

I have added the sections via JavaScript.

I created a function to create a link for each section.

Modified the active class properties the sections.
